Hello World project to help me get started and learn how to use GitHub!

A repository is used to organise a single project. It can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets - anything your project needs.

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. We have the master branch which is considered to be the definitive branch and when we create a branch of master, we are making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at the point in time. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

Saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated message describing a particular change we just made

Once you have made changes in a branch of master, you can open a pull request. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them nto their branch. Pull requests show differences between the two branches.

You can then merge the changes together if there are no conflicts!
